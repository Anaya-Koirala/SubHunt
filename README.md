# **SubHunt: A Submarine Battle Game**  

The vast nothingness of the ocean has been disturbed by a silent enemy! A submarine is lurking somewhere out there, bent on hunting you down. 

No sunlight reaches these depths, no sea creature dares visit these watersâ€”all that exists is the prey and the predator sub. Now it's your job to determine which sub becomes the prey and which becomes the predator.  

## Gameplay  
- Fire torpedoes to attack.  
- Use sonar pings to locate the enemy (*Beware! frequent pings reveal your location*).  
- Predict enemy movement based on the last known ping.  
- Destroy the enemy to advance levels.  

## **Controls**
- *Up, Down, Right, Left* - Move and Turn
- *Space Bar* - Fire Torpedo
- *S* - Sonar Ping
- *E* - Get Last Known Location

## **Debug**
*Note: Not intended for actual gameplay*
- *R* - Randomly place ball (BUG: you may have to press it twice)
- *C* or *`* - Toggle camera (on/off)
